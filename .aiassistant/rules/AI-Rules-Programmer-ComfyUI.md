# AI Rules Programmer ComfyUI

## Before taking action...
- Make sure that you understand key ComfyUI data structures.
- Make sure that you understand key ComfyUI programming paradigms.
- Search or look up any data structures or programming best practices in ComfyUI docs if you have a doubt regarding something.

### ComfyUI Resources

There are several good sources for ComfyUI best practices**, though there isn't one single official "Best Practices" document from the core developers. ComfyUI's community-driven nature means most guidance comes from wikis, community repos, cheatsheets, discussions, and video tutorials. Here's a breakdown of the most useful and up-to-date ones (as of early 2026):

#### Key Resources with Best Practices / Tips
- **ComfyUI Cheatsheet — Tips & Best Practices**  
  Link: https://comfyui-cheatsheet.com/tips

- **ComfyUI Official Documentation** (docs.comfy.org)  
  Link: https://docs.comfy.org/

- **ComfyUI Community Manual** (blenderneko.github.io/ComfyUI-docs)  
  Link: https://blenderneko.github.io/ComfyUI-docs

- **ComfyUI Wiki** (comfyui-wiki.com)  
  Non-official but comprehensive tutorials/manual covering interface, node operations, model installation, embeddings, advanced workflows (e.g., Flux), and FAQ. It includes many practical tips embedded in the guides.

- **GitHub Discussions & Repos**  
  - Specific best practices threads, like [custom node model path recommendations](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI/discussions/2849) (use extra_model_paths.yaml for consistency).  
  - cubiq/ComfyUI_Workflows — Well-documented example workflows that demonstrate "best practice" patterns for various tasks (learning-focused, not always the absolute fastest).
